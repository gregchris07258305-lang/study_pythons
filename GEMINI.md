# Project Overview

This directory contains a collection of Python tutorials for beginners. The tutorials cover fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. The files are a mix of Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`.py`).

## Key Files

The directory `codes/` contains the tutorial files. They are numbered in a suggested learning sequence:

*   `01_variables_string.ipynb`: Introduction to variables and strings.
*   `02_variables_list.ipynb`: Introduction to lists.
*   `03_varlavles_dict.ipynb`: Introduction to dictionaries.
*   `04_variables_bundles.ipynb`: Further exploration of data structures.
*   `05_ifs.py`: Introduction to `if` statements.
*   `06_whiles.py`: Introduction to `while` loops.

## Running the Code

### Python Scripts (`.py`)

To run the Python scripts, you can use the `python` interpreter in your terminal. For example, to run `05_ifs.py`:

```bash
python codes/05_ifs.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

To work with the Jupyter notebooks, you need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can then open the notebook files to view and run the code cells interactively.

To install and run JupyterLab:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter-lab
```

Once JupyterLab is running, you can navigate to the `codes/` directory and open the `.ipynb` files.

## Development Conventions

The tutorial files are numbered sequentially to provide a structured learning path. When adding new tutorials, please follow the existing naming convention.
